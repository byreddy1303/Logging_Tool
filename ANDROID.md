# AIR Journal for Android

AIR Journal uses Capacitor to package the existing React application as a native Android app. The web/PWA and Android builds share the same components, Dexie database, sync engine, authentication, and tests. The APK contains the UI bundle locally; it is not a remote website inside a thin browser.

## Product guarantees

- Solo study writes remain Dexie-first and work offline after the first authenticated launch.
- Supabase sync resumes when connectivity or the app foreground returns.
- Android back dismisses the keyboard first, then navigates, then backgrounds the app from a root screen.
- System bars and every fixed surface respect notches and gesture-navigation insets.
- Haptics are best-effort, restrained, and switchable under Settings → Focus & density.
- The Android build does not register the PWA service worker, preventing stale bundled screens after an APK upgrade.
- Cleartext traffic and Android cloud backup are disabled. No secret or signing key is committed.
- Browser/device push remains absent by product policy.

## Toolchain

- Node 22 or newer (`nvm use` reads `.nvmrc`)
- Android Studio Otter 2025.2.1 or newer
- Android SDK Platform 36 and matching build tools
- JDK 21 (Android Studio's bundled JDK is recommended)

The generated project supports Android 7/API 24 and newer. The application ID is `in.airjournal.app`; changing it after distribution creates a different Android application and must not be done casually.

## First local build

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.capacitor.example .env.capacitor.local
# Fill the VITE_* values used by the production Supabase deployment.

npm run android:apk
```

The debug APK is written to:

```text
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/airjournal.apk
```

Install it on a connected device with Android Studio, or with:

```bash
adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/airjournal.apk
```

For iterative device work, use `npm run android:run`. To inspect the native project, use `npm run android:open`.

## Signed production release

Generate the upload key once and store it outside the repository:

```bash
mkdir -p ../release
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -keystore ../release/air-journal-upload.jks \
  -alias air-journal-upload \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
```

Copy `android/keystore.properties.example` to `android/keystore.properties`, fill the four values, and build a signed APK:

```bash
AIR_VERSION_CODE=1 AIR_VERSION_NAME=1.0.0 npm run android:release
```

The direct-install release artifact is:

```text
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/airjournal-release.apk
```

For a Play Store bundle, run `npm run android:bundle`. The artifact is:

```text
android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

Keep the upload keystore and passwords in a password manager and an encrypted offline backup. Losing the signing key can prevent future direct-install updates from replacing the existing app.

## Release verification matrix

Before sharing a build, verify all of the following on at least one physical phone and one emulator:

1. Fresh install → sign in → Dashboard.
2. Kill and reopen → session remains authenticated.
3. Start a session offline, tag questions, reopen, restore internet → pending count reaches zero.
4. Camera capture and image selection both return to the question editor.
5. PIN entry, planner forms, and Buddy composer remain visible above the keyboard.
6. Android back hides the keyboard, closes navigation naturally, and backgrounds from a root screen.
7. Status bar, bottom navigation, dialogs, and toasts avoid cutouts and gesture areas.
8. Haptics feel subtle and stop immediately when Tactile feedback is disabled.
9. Font scale and compact mode remain usable at 360 px width and Android's enlarged system text.
10. Upgrade over the previous APK preserves IndexedDB data and the active session.
11. Airplane-mode cold launch reaches previously cached local data without a blank screen.
12. `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and `npm audit` remain clean.

## HTTPS app links

The APK handles custom links such as `airjournal://auth` immediately. To make production email links open the installed app directly, add an HTTPS intent filter for the final production domain and publish `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` containing the release certificate SHA-256 fingerprint. Do this only after the domain and signing certificate are final; until then, invitation links safely open the web app.

## Performance budget

- Initial application JavaScript: under 450 kB minified and under 140 kB gzip.
- Normal route chunks: under 50 kB minified unless a clearly isolated heavy tool requires more.
- Interaction feedback begins in the same frame; motion uses transform/opacity and lasts 150–300 ms.
- No autoplay loops, motion-gated actions, remote fonts, or remote HTML shell.

The route-level lazy boundaries and locally bundled fonts are intentional. Do not collapse pages back into one eager import graph.
